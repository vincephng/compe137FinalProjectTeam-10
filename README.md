FoodShare is an application that allows a user to upload their favorite recipes online and share it with others, 
as well as offering a way to discover new recipes. The application will allow a user to maintain a “cookbook” of recipes 
that they can enter in their phone and upload for everyone to see. The uploaded recipes can be “liked” by other users 
and also commented on for ways to improve it. Popular recipes will be shown on a public dashboard with regularly 
“featured recipes” where a user’s recipe will be highlighted. A user can also choose to find a recipe by entering ingredients 
that they currently have, with recipes suggested to them.
